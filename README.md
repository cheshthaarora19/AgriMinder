# AgriMinder - Streamlit Demo App

This is a small demo Streamlit project that replicates the look-and-feel of the provided dashboard image.
It includes a simple SQLite-backed reminders table and scheme eligibility toggles.

## How to run

1. Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # on Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

2. The app will create `agriminder.db` in the project folder to store reminders and schemes.

Enjoy!
